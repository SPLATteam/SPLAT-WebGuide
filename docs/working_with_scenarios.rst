Working with Scenarios
=======================

.. note::
    The SPLAT excel interface is limited in doing scenario management directly. Please add and delete scenarios directly through MESSAGE.

Add a scenario
===================
Scenarios need to be added via the MESSAGE interface. It is recommended that the user makes a copy of an existing scenario through the MESSAGE interface and load it into the SPLAT interface. Refer to :ref:`message_copy_scenario`.
