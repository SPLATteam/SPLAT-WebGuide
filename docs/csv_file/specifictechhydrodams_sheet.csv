Parameter,Parameter Code,Unit,Definition,,
Description,Par_Descr1,,Description of dam hydropower technology. This does not affect any SPLAT functionalities.,,
Corresponding River Tech,Par_river_tech,,Technology code: {CountryCode}RIDM_{ProjectName}},,
River Capacity Max Flow,Par_bdi_up_R,MW,This is a total capacity limit for the corresponding river technology to define the river's max flow in MW derived from max flows in m3/s.,,
Dam Storage Constraint Long Name,Par_storage_con,,Technology code: D_{CountryCode}HYDM_{ProjectName},,
Dam Storage Constraint Short Name,,,"Named as D001, D002, and so on based on dam hydropower technologies in the country.",,
Available dam storage capacity,Par_storage_up,MWyr,"Storage volume that can be used by the power plant in energy terms. This value in MWyr is derived from the Reservoir size in million m3, the energy per unit volume (MJ/m3) and an assumption around minimum volume for reservoir unless this information is available.",,
River-storage coefficient,Par_river_coef,,This is the coefficient for the storage associated with this power plant. +1 means that Each MWyr (or GJ) that flows out of the River Technology will increment the storage level by 1 MWyr or 1 GJ,,
Storage-PP coefficient,Par_stor_coef,,This is the coefficient for the storage associated with this power plant. -1 means that Each MWyr (or GJ) that flows out of the PP Technology will decrease the storage level by 1 MWyr or 1 GJ,,
