"The MESSAGE software comes by default with a free solver called GLPK. "
"This solver is adequate for working with small models, however, when a "
"larger model is to be used (e.g. many timeslices, many technologies and "
"subregions), this solver becomes inadequate requiring a long time to "
"complete a \"RUN\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how_to.rst:39
msgid ""
"There is an alternative free solver that can be used with MESSAGE called "
"the CBC (`Coil-or Branch and Cut solver`_) that is more powerful and can "
"solve larger problems at comparable speeds to some of the commercial "
"solvers such as CPLEX."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how_to.rst:41
msgid ""
"However, to execute runs with this solver one must use the SPLAT Excel "
"Interface to initiate runs (see Tutorial C - Using the SPLAT Excel "
"Interface) and one has to add the solver to the user's existing MESSAGE "
"installation. This guide gives a brief description on how to do this "
"installation."

"1. Download the cbc.rar archive file from the `cbc link`_ and put it in "
"the MESSAGE installation folder called: "
"``C:\\Programs\\MESSAGE_INT\\message_bin``"

"2. Use a 3rd party software such as Winrar to extract the files from "
"``cbc.rar`` into the ``C:\\Programs\\MESSAGE_INT\\message_bin`` folder "
"(use \"extract here\") Some of the files may already exist in the folder,"
" you can accept to overwrite those files with the ones from the "
"``cbc.rar`` archive."
