Customized styling by Yunshu:
To use the styling below, add the following command at the beginning of the .rst file:
.. role:: inputcell
    :class: inputcell
.. role:: interfacecell
    :class: interfacecell
.. role:: button
    :class: button

You can then use the styling in the text:
	:button:`button text` (for use when referring to a button in SPLAT interface)
	:interfacecell:`interface text`
	:inputcell:`input text`
